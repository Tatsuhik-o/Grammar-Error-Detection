# Grammar-Error-Detection
Python Script that detects grammatical error within an essay.

Please follow these steps:
* Make a TXT file called "essay.txt" and put your essay in it (FILE HAS TO BE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS THE SCRIPT).

* RapidAPI Account: Make sure you have a RapidAPI account. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for free at https://rapidapi.com/signup.

* GrammarBot API Subscription: Ensure that you have subscribed to the GrammarBot API on the RapidAPI platform. You should receive an API key after subscribing to the API.

* Use Correct API Key: Replace "YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY" in the script with your actual RapidAPI key that you obtained from the GrammarBot API subscription.

After updating the script with the correct API key, you should be able to access the GrammarBot API and then run the script.

If you encounter any further issues or have additional questions, please let me know, and I'll be happy to assist you further.
